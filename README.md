just some DOM maniputation stuff.

OK! Well it's a bit more than that, I've been doin' development for a couple of years now and I got to the point where I start to learn React on the FCC curriculum. It was at this point that I realised I hadn't built much stuff i.e. not practiced using __html, css__ enough so that it just rolls off my finger tips like writing a report, or something. At this moment in time I think it's really important to have that html/css stuff nailed if you want to have total control over the design of your app/site.

So, here we are, just doing basic stuff to build solid foundations that are required to create the front end design visually, whilst at the same time digging into the techniques of manipulating the DOM.
